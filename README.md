# Shaper
Shaper is a simple game made in 24 hours for the Ludum Dare 35 game jam competition.

## Gameplay
You must constantly keep changing the shape of your polygon to fit the incoming shapes. When an incoming shape is completely inside your polygon, you lose if you are not the same shape.

## Controls
Use the Up and Down arrow keys to increase and decrease the number of sides of your polygon.

## Modification
Feel free to fork this project to experiment with DE2D.
To run the game on your computer, simply download the repository (.zip), extract the files, and open "index.html" in your web browser.

## Conclusion
It was an interesting and fulfilling experience to use my own library to make a game for a competiton. DE2D supplied everything that the simple game needed to be completed within the time restriction.

> **Note:** This project is currently using an older release of DE2D, which does not include mobile touch support. I am not updating the library file(s), or maintaining the game logic code to preserve my competition submission.
